  Introduction
  ------------
	We set out to make an Advance Wars clone using Unity and GitHub. We ended with a small game where you can move a tank and kill small infantry.

### What We Implemented:

-Tile Based Movement
-A Working Combat system where damage is calculated by unit type and unit health
-A Clear Set of Rules
-Capture of Special Tiles Such as Cities and Factories
-Healing
-UI
-Sounds
-Permanent Death
-Start Menu

### What We Failed to Implement

-Terain Affected Status Boosts
-Counter Attack
-Multiple characters to start with
-Terrain Affected Movement
-Plenty of Options in our UI
-Breakable Terrain
